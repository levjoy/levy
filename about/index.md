![me](/img/levy.jpeg)

I’m CTO and co-founder of [Center for Digital Resilience (CDR)](https://digiresilience.org), a global NGO that facilitates digital security support for communities around the world.

I was a 2017 non-resident fellow at Stanford’s [Digital Civil Society Lab](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/research/digital-civil-society-lab/). I also hold an MFA in [Integrated Media Arts](https://ima-mfa.hunter.cuny.edu/) from Hunter College, City University of New York.

<p>My band is called [Outro](/posts/outro).</p>

<p>I live in western Massachusetts, USA with my wife and kids.</p>
