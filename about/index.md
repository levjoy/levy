![me](/img/levy.jpeg)

I’m CTO and co-founder of Center for Digital Resilience (CDR), a global NGO that facilitates digital security support for communities around the world.
I was a 2017 non-resident fellow at Stanford’s Digital Civil Society Lab. I also hold an MFA in Integrated Media Arts from Hunter College, City University of New York.
My band is called Outro.

I live in western Massachusetts, USA with my wife and kids.
